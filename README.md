# JPA Projects
### Daniel Clark

## Description
The JPA Projects repository contains multiple web projects created during the process of learning JPA (Java Persistence API) in association with SpringMVC and other technologies. These projects consist of code written individually, in coordination with other students, and with the help of instructors.
